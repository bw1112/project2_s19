        "The PageRank algorithm is used to rank the importance of nodes in a graph. It works by counting the number of edges incident to a node to determine how important the node is. The underlying assumption is that more important nodes are likely to receive more links from other nodes. Find the top 100 nodes with the highest PageRank in the graph.\n",
        "Hint: It is not possible to use \"WITH RECURSIVE\" on BigQuery. You must develop a iterative implementation for PageRank (like the BFS example mentioned below).\n",
        "\n",
        "You must run the algorithm for 20 iterations and your output table should contain the following columns:\n",
        "- twitter_username (the twitter_username of the user)\n",
        "- page_rank_score\n",
        "\n",
        "Just like ``testquery``, you should return the output of ``job.results()`` in a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "You must implement only the simplified version of the PageRank algorithm. \n",
        "This algorithm works as follows - Assume a small universe of four web pages: A, B, C and D. PageRank is initialized to the same value for all pages since we assume a probability distribution between 0 and 1 as the PageRank for each node. Hence the initial value for each page in this example is 0.25. If the only links in the system were from pages B->A, C->A and D->A, each link would transfer 0.25 PageRank to A upon the next iteration, for a total of 0.75 i.e. PR(A) = PR(B) + PR(C) + PR(D). \n",
        "\n",
        "Now, suppose instead that we have the links B->C, B->A, C->A, D->A, D->B, D->C. Thus, upon the first iteration, page B would transfer half of its existing value, or 0.125, to page A and the other half, or 0.125, to page C. Page C would transfer all of its existing value, 0.25, to the only page it links to, A. Since D had three outbound links, it would transfer one third of its existing value, or approximately 0.083, to A. At the completion of this iteration, page A will have a PageRank of approximately 0.458.\n",
        "PR(A)=PR(B)/2 + PR(C)/1 + PR(D)/3.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, we can write the PageRank of A as:\n",
        "PR(A)= PR(B)/L(B) + PR(C)/L(C) + PR(D)/L(D) where L(x) gives us the number of outbound links for any node x. \n",
        "\n",
        "In general, the PageRank value for a page u is dependent on the PageRank values for each page v contained in the set containing all pages linking to page u, divided by the number of links from page v. \n",
        "It is given by the formula: ![](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-aafd3a0d9f8bb8325cf2b41a4a839bbf_l3.svg)\n",
        "\n",
        "To read more about PageRank, you can refer to the following link: [PageRank](http://home.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~wkshum/papers/pagerank.pdf)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "For this question, you will need to develop an iterative solution, i.e. your python code will act as a driver and issue multiple queries to BigQuery iteratively. As an example, we provided an iterative implementation of Breadth First Search on the starter code.\n",
        "\n",
        "To execute 5 iterations using A as a start node, you can simply call ``bfs(client, 'A', 5)``.\n",
        "\n",
        "The example saves the nodes visited at each iteration in a table ``distances``, along with their distance to the initial node. The function itself does not return any value (however, remind that you will be required to return values for Q7)."
